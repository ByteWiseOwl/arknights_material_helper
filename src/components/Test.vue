      “So I’m a Spider, So What?” tells the story of a school class that are
      completely wiped out by a rupture in the world and are consequently reborn
      in a fantasy world that seems to function similarly to a role-playing
      game. Though the students don’t all take on a human form—some of them have
      to act as animal beings from now on. The protagonist of the story is
      probably the worst-off of all, as she returns to the previously unknown
      world as a spider. The girl was excluded from her class in her previous
      life and was thus an outsider, which is why she must now once again figure
      out how to fend for herself alone. Will she manage to survive in this
      world or possibly die a cruel death …?
